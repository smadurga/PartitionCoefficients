Computational method to predict partition coefficients, which describe the distribution of a solute between two immiscible phases at equilibrium. Experimental determination of these coefficients in complex systems can be costly and time-intensive. The research utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and a solvation model based on density (SMD) to estimate octanol/water and octanol/air partition coefficients for polar solvents. The results align closely with experimental data, validating the approach as a reliable alternative for unknown solvents.

Key findings:

    - The SMD model paired with DFT functionals (B3LYP, M06-2X, and M11) accurately reproduces experimental values.
    
    - M11 functional performs best for octanol/water coefficients, while M06-2X excels for octanol/air coefficients.
    
    - This is the first reported computational prediction of octanol/air partition coefficients using DFT, demonstrating high accuracy and precision.
